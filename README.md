## üéØ Strategy Modes

### Wide Tide Mode
Enters trades when Bollinger Bands are **wide** (high volatility) and price touches the outer bands.

**Logic:**
- Band width must exceed threshold percentage
- Long: Price closes below lower band
- Short: Price closes above upper band

**Best For:** Volatile markets, mean reversion trading

**Configuration:**
```
Mode: "Wide Tide"
Wide Tide Threshold: 2.5% (default)
```

### Distance Capture Mode
Enters trades at a **custom percentage** distance between the middle and outer bands.

**Logic:**
- Calculates entry level as % of distance from middle to outer band
- Long: Price crosses below entry level
- Short: Price crosses above entry level

**Best For:** Precise entry timing, range-bound markets

**Configuration:**
```
Mode: "Distance Capture"
Distance Capture Entry %: 25% (default)
```

---

## üîç Filter Systems

### BROC (Basis Rate of Change)
Measures the **slope angle** of the Bollinger Band middle line (basis).

- **Calculation**: Uses `arctan(slope)` converted to degrees
- **Purpose**: Confirms trend direction
- **Threshold**: Minimum angle required for entry
- **Multiplier**: Scaling factor for sensitivity

```
Use BROC Filter: ‚úì
BROC Length: 14
BROC Threshold: 0.5¬∞
BROC Scaling Multiplier: 1.0
```

### UPROC (Upper Band Rate of Change)
Measures the **slope angle** of the upper Bollinger Band.

- **Purpose**: Confirms upper band expansion/contraction
- **Bullish**: Upper band expanding upward
- **Bearish**: Upper band contracting downward

```
Use UPROC Filter: ‚òê
UPROC Length: 14
UPROC Threshold: 0.5¬∞
UPROC Scaling Multiplier: 1.0
```

### LOROC (Lower Band Rate of Change)
Measures the **slope angle** of the lower Bollinger Band.

- **Purpose**: Confirms lower band expansion/contraction
- **Bullish**: Lower band expanding downward
- **Bearish**: Lower band contracting upward

```
Use LOROC Filter: ‚òê
LOROC Length: 14
LOROC Threshold: 0.5¬∞
LOROC Scaling Multiplier: 1.0
```

### Marubozu Filter
Identifies **strong directional candles** with minimal wicks.

- **Bullish Marubozu**: Large green body, small wicks ‚Üí strong buying
- **Bearish Marubozu**: Large red body, small wicks ‚Üí strong selling
- **Visual**: Triangle indicators appear on qualifying candles

```
Use Marubozu Filter: ‚òê
Marubozu Body % of Range: 70%
Marubozu Max Wick % of Body: 15%
```

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Entry Management

### ScoopTime
Triggers entries **X seconds before candle close** on any timeframe.

**How It Works:**
- Calculates timeframe duration in seconds
- Determines bars until close
- Triggers when within scoop window
- **Bar-stable**: No repainting issues

```
Enable ScoopTime: ‚òê
Seconds Before Close: 30
```

**Example:** On 5-minute chart with 30s ScoopTime:
- Candle opens at 10:00:00
- ScoopTime triggers at 10:04:30
- Entry conditions checked in final 30 seconds

### Delay Entry
Stores entry signals and executes after **X candles delay**.

**How It Works:**
1. Entry signal detected ‚Üí stored with bar index
2. Waits for specified number of candles
3. Executes entry after delay period
4. Clears stored signal after execution

```
Enable Delay Entry: ‚òê
Delay Candles: 1
```

**Use Cases:**
- Confirm signal strength
- Wait for pullback confirmation
- Avoid false breakouts

### Cooldown System
Prevents rapid re-entry after a trade closes.

**Cooldown Types:**
- **Candles**: Wait X bars before next entry
- **Time**: Wait X minutes before next entry

**Apply To Options:**
- **Same Direction**: Separate cooldowns for long/short
- **Both Directions**: Single cooldown for all trades

```
Enable Cooldown: ‚òê
Cooldown Type: "Candles"
Cooldown Candles: 5
Cooldown Minutes: 60
Apply To: "Same Direction"
```

**Example - Same Direction:**
- Long trade closes at bar 100
- Next long cannot enter until bar 105
- Short trades can still enter immediately

**Example - Both Directions:**
- Any trade closes at bar 100
- No trades (long or short) until bar 105

## üéØ Exit Management

### Dual Take-Profit System

#### TP1 (First Take Profit)
- **Closes**: 50% of position
- **Triggers**: Price OR time-based
- **Action**: Can move SL to breakeven

```
Enable TP1: ‚úì
TP1 %: 2.0%
TP1 Max Candles: 0 (disabled)
```

#### TP2 (Second Take Profit)
- **Closes**: Remaining 50% of position
- **Triggers**: Price OR time-based
- **Action**: Activates redundancy probes

```
Enable TP2: ‚úì
TP2 %: 4.0%
TP2 Max Candles: 0 (disabled)
```

### Stop Loss
- **Fixed Percentage**: Set distance from entry
- **Breakeven Move**: Auto-adjusts after TP1 (optional)

```
Stop Loss %: 1.5%
Move SL to Breakeven after TP1: ‚úì
```

### Time-Based Exits
Both TP1 and TP2 can close positions after a maximum number of candles:
- `0` = Disabled (price-only exit)
- `> 0` = Close after X candles regardless of price

**Example:**
```
TP1 Max Candles: 10
```
If TP1 price target not hit within 10 candles ‚Üí close 50% anyway

### Redundancy Probes
Automated alert system that sends **repeated notifications** after trade closure.

**How It Works:**
1. Trade closes (TP or SL hit)
2. System activates probe mode
3. Sends alerts every X seconds
4. Stops after 5 probes (customizable in code)

```
Enable Redundancy Probes: ‚òê
Time Between Probes: 60 seconds
```

**Use Cases:**
- Webhook reliability
- API confirmation
- Logging/monitoring

## üìä Performance

### Optimization Tips

#### For Backtesting Speed
- Disable unused filters

- Limit lookback period
- Disable visual plots when not needed

#### For Live Trading
- Enable ScoopTime for precise entries
- Use Redundancy Probes for webhook reliability
- Set appropriate cooldown to avoid overtrading
- Monitor BROC/UPROC/LOROC angles in data window

#### For Different Market Conditions

**Trending Markets:**
- Enable BROC filter (higher threshold)
- Use Distance Capture mode (lower %)
- Wider stop loss, larger TP2

**Range-Bound Markets:**
- Use Wide Tide mode
- Enable Marubozu filter
- Tighter stop loss, smaller TPs

**High Volatility:**
- Increase BB Multiplier (2.5-3.0)
- Enable cooldown system
- Use time-based TP exits
